        Readings.
      </p>

      <p>Here are my reflections on some interesting papers/articles I have read through time.</p>
    
      <section class="readings">

        <div class="reading" style="padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid; width: auto; height: auto;">
          <!-- <p>Enhancing Our Lives with Immersive Virtual Reality</p> -->
          <code style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b>#1 Enhancing Our Lives with Immersive Virtual Reality • Slater, M., & Sanchez-Vives, M. V. (2016) </b></code><br>
          <code style="font-size: 1em;">As I started reading this paper, I was curious about how Virtual Reality (VR) can be applied to the diverse sectors of
            human life, and what the results may be.
            There were lots of sections in the paper talking about the use of VR in many aspects in human life, but I am going to highlight the ones that were more interested to me.

            <br><br>The first one was the combination of it with Data Visualization & Education together. Data are the oil of the 21st century, and the ability to visualise them in various forms (both statistical
            and non) is already giving us insights about a topic. But, with the use of this technology one can <i>immerse in</i> the data and experiment with these in new ways, like
            touching, speaking, etc. An example I though of, is an Electrical engineer learning to program micro-computers (like Arduino). Instead of trying to experiment with a physical device, he can experiment inside
            a virtual world, without the danger to damage the device (e.g. from wrong cable connection) and also trying many combinations. In parallel, data like wats can be
            seen virtually in real-time and make the comprehension deeper.
            <br><br>Sports is another amazing field where VR can change drastically. Both as a spectator and a player. As a spectator, one is given the chance to watch the game from different angles,
            following the action all the time, and getting better experience. Also, the nature of the technology, automatically eliminates the need to pay for better placed seats 
            (e.g. more close to the field of play) because everybody will be able to access all points of views concurently without physical presence, so the same cost will be available. But, there is
            high posibility that a separation of accesible views in premium, free or some other business model will exist. After all, all this equipment need to bought, maintained, replaced, etc.
            As a player, teams or inividuals can improve strategy through training inside the virtual world, when exposed in various situations. If I think of it accompanied by visuotactile synchrony
            it can get much close to real situations.

          <!-- <p>Enhancing Our Lives with Immersive Virtual Reality</p> -->
          <code style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b>#2 “Would You Give a Virtual Electric Shock to an Avatar?” • Mar Gonzalez-Franco, Mel Slater on April 12, 2019</b></code><br>
          <code style="font-size: 1em;">This article, from my point of view, shows the inner good "human" that each person hides inside. Even though, many participants
            knew they were harming an avatar, they still tried to help it answer, so as not to activate the electric shock. The higher level of stress was also is
            justified for 2 reasons: 1) they did not want to get caught helping the "victim" and more important for me, 2) the inner battle with their consciousness.
            <br>Another thing I foundinteresting, was the Miligram experiment itself.
